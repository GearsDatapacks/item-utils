# Item utils

Item utils is a datapack by Gears that adds lots of small features to help display certain things in Minecraft survival without using cheats.\
\
How to use: You can access the main menu by reloading or running the command `/trigger item_utils.main_menu`. This gives you a list of clickable buttons that will perform each of the different features. You can also trigger each feature manually.

Current features: 
- Custom model data: Triggered by running `/trigger item_utils.custom_model_data set <custom model data value>`. This will set the custom model data of the item in your hand to whatever you specify as \<custom model data value\>. This command won't run automatically from the main menu as you need to input a number.

- Invisible item frames: Triggered by running `/trigger item_utils.invisible_item_frame`. If you are holding an item frame (glow or  normal), it will rename it to "Invisible" and when you place it down it will indeed be invisible.

- Text display: Triggered by running `/trigger item_utils.text_display`. This will place a text display at your feet, the content of which is equal to the name of the item in your mainhand.

- Item display: Triggered by running `/trigger item_utils.item_display`. This will take the item it your hand and place it in a floating item display entity.

- Remove display entity: Triggered by running `/trigger item_utils.display_entity`. This removes the closest display entity to you in case you messed up or just want to remove it. (It will drop items from item displays)

- Name styling: Triggered by running `/trigger item_utils.style_name`. This will help you format the current item in your hand, either for text displays or other purposes. It has a variety of options including different colours, and formats such as *italics* and **bold**.
